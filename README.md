 This project should at the end be able to take a local user audio file, analyze it and visualise the audio while playing.
 For this to work I need figure out how to:
 - dynamically create a filesystem link to the audio file
 - analyze the audio file (api?)
 - make the audio play simultaneously with the visualization ? realtime ? time the playback?
    - functionality for recognizing the amount of ms elapsed at current location of audio file.
